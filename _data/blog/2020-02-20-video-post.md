#Sample Data Below:

* **Species Name**: 
    * *Black Grouper*
#
 * **Fishery Management**:

    * *Both the commercial and recreational fisheries have size limits to reduce harvest of immature black grouper.The commercial and recreational fishing seasons are closed from January through April to protect black grouper during their peak spawning period*
#
 * **Habitat**: 

    * *Juvenile black grouper can occur in seagrass and oyster rubble habitat in the Carolinas, and along reefs in the Florida Keys and in Brazil. Adults prefer rocky bottoms, drop-off walls and ledges, caves, crevices, and coral and artificial reefs. Black grouper are relatively sedentary and can remain in one particular site for some time. They move to progressively deeper waters as they age. They are found inshore up to depths of 656 feet (200 meters). Adults are solitary, but in some instances form small groups. Adults make seasonal migrations to spawning sites where they form large spawning aggregations*
#
* **Region**: 
    * *Black grouper are found in the western Atlantic from Massachusetts to Brazil.They are particularly associated with the southern Gulf of Mexico, Florida Keys, Cuba, the Bahamas, and throughout the Caribbean. The US stock primarily occurs in the Florida Keys*
#
* **Availablity**: 
    * *Year-round in the Gulf of Mexico. There are seasonal closures from January through April in the South Atlantic and from February through April in the U.S Caribbean*
#
* **Health Benefits**: 
    * *Grouper is low in saturated fat. It is a good source of vitamins B6 and B12, phosphorus, potassium, protein and selenium. More information on https://www.fishwatch.gov/eating-seafood/health* 
#
* **Taste**: 
    * *Grouper has a mild but distinct flavor, somewhere between bass and halibut. Gag is sometimes mistakenly referred to as black grouper in the market. The two species are very similar in taste and texture*
